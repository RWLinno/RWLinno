&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üî•Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy reposeTo the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,And in the calmest and most stillest night,With all appliances and means to boot,Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.üî•
